# Manufacturing System Discrete-Event Simulation

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a discrete-event simulation to model a high-volume automotive parts manufacturing line.

## Objectives

- Optimize throughput for a single product line
- Identify and mitigate production bottlenecks
- Analyze impacts of operational variables through scenario analysis
- Bonus: Extend the simulation to handle multiple product types

## System Description

The production line is divided into several phases: raw material handling, machining, assembly, quality control, and packaging.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SimPy library

### Installation

```bash
pip install simpy
